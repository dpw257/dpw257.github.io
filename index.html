								<h3>My data journey</h3>
								</header>
								<div class="row">
								<div class="col-6 col-12-mobile">
								<p>
									Working as a translator at a business consultancy, I was constantly reading about the innovations 
									happening in vastly different industries due to digitalisation, and I
									was deeply impressed by the measurable impact data-driven projects were having in growing our 
									clients' revenues, so I decided to make the jump to a new career path.
								</p>
								<p>
									My stepping stone into data was a master's degree in computational linguistics, where there was significant
									overlap between NLP use cases, such as machine translation and sentiment analysis, and my previous work. 
									For a final project, I investigated a topic I had been passionate about for some time, applying 
									classical machine learning to research linguistic change in a minority language.
								</p>
								<p>
									I continued to climb data mountain, with bachelor studies in data science through the Open University 
									and a data engineering bootcamp, picking up skills in statistical methods, mathematical modelling, Python 
									programming, data pipelines and visualisation along the way, as shown in the data projects above.

								<h3>Business knowledge</h3>
								</header>
								<div class="row">
								<div class="col-6 col-12-narrow">
								<p>Through my career in business communications, I became familiar with a variety of marketing concepts, applicable to various industries, 
									many of which have data collection and analysis at their core.<br>
									By tapping the full potential of data, companies can discover how to allocate their resources more effectively, 
									make their products more attractive, grow a loyal base of satisfied customers, and increase their 
									profitability year on year.</p><br>
								<h1>Price</h1>
								<p>Understanding customer expectations on product and price is key to success. Prices should be optimised 
									based on the value of the product as perceived by the customer.<br>With customer segmentation, we 
									cluster customers into groups that share similar characteristics and preferences. Since each customer 
									segment's willingness to pay is different, products can be adapted to create basic and premium alternatives
									with prices to suit every pocket.</p><br>
								<h1>Product</h1>
								<p>Data from sensors allows manufacturers to monitor product performance in real-time, detect possible faults  
									and automatically alert technicians when maintainance checks are due.<br>
									In logistics, just-in-time delivery systems also rely on sensor data for monitoring deliveries to the warehouse 
									to reduce lead times, while sales data can be used predictively to model the future buying behaviour of customers 
									and determine the best time to deliver products to stores.<br>
									For web-based services, analysing user data enables companies to improve their products, 
									whether by A/B testing new features or by finding trends in customer feedback that reveal 
									which features are causing issues.</p><br>
								<h1>Customer experience</h1>
								<p>Customer journeys that integrate online and bricks-and-mortar touchpoints offer customers the added convenience 
									of being able to research a product online, receive personalised support from a sales 
									assistant in store, and make their purchase whenever they are ready from their mobile phone.<br>
									For a seamless customer experience, personal information and product preferences should be collected and shared between 
									each touchpoint, insofar as GDPR regulations are met.<br>Customer interactions that use data effectively increase satisfaction, 
									improve conversion rates, and provide companies with an in-depth understanding of their customers.</p><br>
								<h1>Sales</h1>
								<p>Rather than sales teams handing out discounts through rule of thumb, a robust concessions system with clearly defined escalation 
									thresholds can be developed by analysing the efficacy of previously granted discounts to ensure future discounts 
									generate lasting value for the company.</p>
