									<h3>Hi there!</h3><br>
									<p>With a genuine passion for turning raw data into solutions that tackle real-world challenges, my expertise covers everything from data analysis and engineering to data quality and computational linguistics. I've had the opportunity to work with cloud technologies like AWS, building end-to-end data pipelines that not only clean and transform large datasets but also apply advanced analytical methods to uncover actionable business insights. In my work, I place significant importance on understanding short- and long-term business goals, communicating effectively with stakeholders and continually improving my methods and approach.</p>

									<h3>Data analysis and statistics</h3><br>
									<p>Working at a business consultancy, I was so impressed by the impact I saw data-driven approaches were having in transforming industries and maximising revenue that I decided to switch to a career in data science. Bachelor's studies equipped me with strong skills in data analysis, applied mathematics and statistics, while a master's degree in computational linguistics allowed me to explore NLP applications such as machine translation and sentiment analysis, which cumulated in a capstone project in which I applied machine learning techniques to study linguistic change in a minority language. My experience with business strategy allows me to bridge the gap between technical solutions and business needs, whether it's optimizing product pricing, enhancing customer experience, or analysing sales performance.</p>

									<h3>Data engineering and quality</h3><br>
									<p>With a keen eye for detail, I have a particular interest in data quality, implementing efficient processes for cleaning, validating, and transforming data to ensure accuracy and reliability. From optimizing data storage and retrieval to ensuring data integrity, I am dedicated to building scalable solutions that support high-quality, actionable insights, all while leveraging cutting-edge technologies and cloud platforms to streamline and automate processes. I prioritise presenting data in a clear, engaging way that enables teams to easily monitor performance, identify areas for improvement and make informed decisions. By creating intuitive visualizations, interactive dashboards and reports, I ensure that complex data insights are accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences.</p>

									<h3>Portfolio projects</h3><br>
									<p>Browse my portfolio of projects I've tackled. Each project showcases not just my technical skills, but also my dedication to delivering top-notch solutions that truly address business needs. From dynamic pricing models and product recommendation systems to building data lakes and automating data pipelines, Iâ€™m always on the lookout for exciting new challenges that help me grow and refine my data science and engineering expertise.</p>
