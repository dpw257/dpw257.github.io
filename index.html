									<h3>Welcome to my portfolio!</h3 align="left"><br>
									<p>In these projects, I use a variety of platforms and tools to solve data problems from 
										different industries and fields, incorporating my technical knowhow, business 
										knowledge and professional approaches. Each report outlines the project's objectives, 
										methodology and key findings. To explore the code behind a project, please click the 
										link to the relevant GitHub repository!
										<br> <br>
										My skillset draws from data analysis and data engineering, including an interest in 
										data quality, along with a specialisation in NLP/computational linguistics. I'm also 
										familiar with the principles of GDPR compliance. With this portfolio, I have tried to 
										reflect my varied capabilities, particularly the use of Python (Jupyter, OOP), Power BI, 
										SQL, the AWS cloud platform and ETL processes, and I will continue to expand it with future 
										projects â€“ a data practitioner is always learning!</p>
									<br>

								<div class="frame">
									<h3>Data analysis and visualisation</h3><br>
									<p>The challenge of data analysis is to think beyond the obvious. By knowing how to ask the right questions, 
										I'm able to uncover meaningful relationships in my data, which is why I strive to gain a solid understanding 
										of the scope of the project and business context. I select my methods and tools according to the task, 
										for example, I'd use time series analysis for forecasting market trends, while I'd conduct multiple linear 
										regression to identify the causes of inefficiency on a production line. By employing statistical techniques 
										such as calculating confidence intervals, I'm able to quantify the reliability of my conclusions. To visualise 
										my results, I use tools like Power BI to create reports and dashboards and Python libraries to generate effective 
										charts. I prioritise presenting data in a way that reflects the expertise and time constraints of the audience, 
										highlighting the key findings that reveal the story behind data.</p>
									<br>

								<!-- Third paragraph frame -->
								<div class="frame">
									<h3>Data engineering and quality</h3><br>
									<p>There is no one-size-fits-all solution to data problems. Designing an effective approach is highly task-specific 
										and depends on users' expectations regarding processing, whether they need to monitor data flows live or 
										intend to conduct in-depth analyses on large datasets. I can integrate different AWS services, from Amazon MSK and 
										Redshift, into a pipeline to handle real-time data and ensure robust storage, with high performance and the 
										possibility to scale as needed. I also have experience automating repetitive tasks using DAGs on Apache Airflow. 
										Since data quality is a critical aspect of any data pipeline, I implement validation checks early to detect 
										anomalies, clean data before processing and use monitoring tools to identify and resolve issues swiftly. </p>
								</div>
						
								<!-- Fourth paragraph frame -->
								<div class="frame">
									<h3>Professional experience and education</h3><br>
									<p>My interest in data science began while working at a top international business consultancy. 
										The success of the data-driven projects I encountered there inspired me to make the leap. 
										Through bachelor's and master's studies, I gained a strong foundation in data analysis, 
										mathematics and statistics, and I also had the opportunity to explore exciting applications 
										of NLP, such as machine translation and sentiment analysis. My studies culminated in a 
										capstone project, applying computational linguistics to investigate a minority language. 
										Combining these skills with my business strategy background, the technical solutions I 
										develop are guided by the aim of achieving lasting revenue growth as well as contributing 
										to wider business goals.</p>
