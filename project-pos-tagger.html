										<h2>Part-of-speech Tagger for a Minority Language</h2>
										<p>

										</p>
									</header>
									<p><b><i>
										The Irish government spends 1.2 billion euros annually on fostering the Irish language and aims to raise 
										the number of daily speakers to 250,000 by 2030.
									</b></p></i>
									<p><b><i>
										While an increasing number of English speakers are the learning the language, the traditional dialects 
										of Irish are disappearing. Linguists have observed fundamental changes in the way the language is spoken 
										due to the influence of English. Young native speakers increasingly use English-influenced syntax and fewer 
										complex sentence structures.
									</b></p></i>
									<p><b><i>
										Since previous research focused primarily on spoken Irish, changes to the written language were investigated 
										to provide further insight into the current linguistic situation to help inform language policy and 
										investment decisions.

											<h3>1. Project objectives</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											&nbsp; &#x25cf; &nbsp; Develop a tool that automatically labels tokens in a sentence with their grammatical function to high granularity.
											<br>
											&nbsp; &#x25cf; &nbsp; Train and test the POS tagger on a diachronic corpus (collection of texts written across a large timespan).
											<br>
											&nbsp; &#x25cf;	&nbsp; Analyse changes in frequency of selected syntactical features over time.
										</p><br>
									</section>
									<section>
										<header>
											<h3>2. Methodology</h3>
										</header>
										<p>The two syntactical features investigated were:<br>
											&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x25CB; &nbsp; Ratio of complex sentences to simple sentences<br>
											&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x25CB; &nbsp; Ratio of synthetic to analytic verb forms<br><br>
											A tagset was created for this purpose that included tags for markers of sentence complexity 
											(i.e. conjunctions) and tags for different verb forms and tenses.
											</p><br>
										<h1>2.1. Data collection and preprocessing</h1><br>
										<p>A corpus consisting of 6000 sentences from a single publication spanning the years 1960 to 2020 was digitised with OCR, proofread and manually 
											tagged with the newly defined tagset.
											<br><br>
											The dataset was duplicated to create one version for calculating the emission probabilities (the likelihood of a token corresponding 
											to a specific part of speech) and another version for calculating the transition probabilities (the likelihood of a part of speech 
											being followed by another specific part of speech). To reduce the occurance of out-of-vocabulary tokens, sequences of additional tagged 
											tokens were added to the emission dataset, namely lists of numbers, individual letters, common English words, and verb forms of common 
											Irish verbs.

										<h1>2.2. Model design</h1><br>
										<p>To tag the tokens in the corpus, a hidden Markov model (HMM) was used to calculate the probability of each token 
											in the dataset being a particular part of speech (emission probability) and predict which POS-tag was most likely 
											to be the next one in the sequence (transmission probability).<br><br>
											The hidden Markov model was coupled with a Viterbi algorithm (written in Python) to reduce the computational power required 
											to find the most likely tag pathway by eliminating low probability tokens from the calculation.											
										</p><br>

										  </div>
										<span style="font-size:10pt"><i>Figure 2: Section of code from HMM/Viterbi model</i></span></p><br>
										<p>The corpus was split randomly 75/25 into training and test sets with equal proportions of sentences from each decade. To reduce the 
											likelihood of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) tokens, tables of common Irish verbs were added to the training data, ensuring non-zero 
											emission probabilities for these tokens.</p><br>
										<h1>2.3. Performance metrics</h1><br>
										<p>&nbsp; &#x25cf; &nbsp; Overall accuracy score for  model and for each decade in the corpus.
											<br>
											&nbsp; &#x25cf; &nbsp; Precision, recall, and F-score individual verb tags, complexity markers tags and overall model.
											<br>
											&nbsp; &#x25cf; &nbsp; All analyses calculated for both unigram and bigram transmission probabilities.
										</p><br>
										<h1>2.4. Limitations</h1><br>
										<p>To prevent underflow due to the multiplication of small decimal probabilities, the probability values of sentences with 
											fewer than 20 tokens are multiplied by 10 at each node in the hidden Markov model, while sentences with 20 or more tokens 
											are multiplied by 1000 at each node. The outcome of the tagging is unaffected. </p><br>

											<h3>3. Results</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											The unigram model achieved higher overall accuracy (88.0%) than the bigram model (78.9%), so the unigram model was 
											chosen for conducting the linguistic evaluation of the corpus. 
											The individual f-scores for specific tags demonstrate that the model is able to correctly tag parts of speech for 
											Irish, including the specific linguistic features being investigated.

										  </div>
										<span style="font-size:10pt"><i>Figure 3: Precision, recall, f-scores for complexity marker tags (unigram model)</i></span></p><br>
										<p>The model struggles to correctly tag relative pronouns, since the token 'a' can signify a relative pronoun [rel], a possessive 
											pronoun [pos], or a particle [par]. This lowered the overall f-score for complexity tags as a result. 
											For this reason, the category 'relative pronoun' was later excluded from the linguistic analysis.
											There is also some ambiguity between [sconj] (subordinating conjunction) or [conj] (coordinating conjunction) tags.

										  </div>
										<span style="font-size:10pt"><i>Figure 4: Confusion matrix for complexity marker tags (unigram model)</i></span></p><br>
										<p>Both models (unigram and bigram) achieved similar precision, recall and f-score values in tagging verb 
											forms. The score were higher than for complexity tags, since verb tags are relatively unambiguous. The unigram scores slightly 
											higher overall (91.5% accuracy). The inclusion of tables of common Irish verb verbs to the emission data also improved accuracy. 
										</p><br>

										<span style="font-size:10pt"><i>Figure 5: Precision, recall, f-scores for verb form tags (unigram model)</i></span></p><br>
										<p>In the linguistic analysis, a shift away from synthetic to toward analytic verb forms was observed. No clear trend regarding 
											change in sentence complexity since 1960 was found.

											<h3>4. Insights</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											To improve the analysis of sentence complexity, the tags for coordinating conjunctions and subordinating conjunctions 
											could be combined into a single tag, reducing the number of false positives and false negatives. To reduce the ambiguity of
											the relative pronoun 'a', additional information regarding its grammatical agreement with the following verb (initial 
											letter mutation) could be added as a marker to the tag to assist the model.
										</p>
										<p>The investigation found that sentence complexity hasn't declined in formal written texts since 1960, while previous research 
											has identified a reduction in complexity in younger native speakers. Therefore, formal written texts offer a high-quality 
											linguistic source for developing learning material for younger speakers, if the government seeks to invest in raising the 
											richness of the spoken language.
										</p>
										<p>Further research could continue to monitor formal publications to determine whether changes 
											occur in writing style over the coming years. The scope of research could be broadened to include less formal sources such 
											as social media posts, blogs and texts by second-language users.
