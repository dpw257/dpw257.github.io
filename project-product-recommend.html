										<h2>Customer Segmentation and Product Recommend Engine with Dynamic Pricing</h2>
										<p>

										</p>
									</header>
									<p><b><i>
										An electronics company decided to target existing customers with suggested products and discounts tailored to their purchasing 
										behaviour and overall value to the company, in order to maximise customer loyalty and increase revenue.
									</b></p></i>
									<p><b><i>
										Customers were segmented based on the value and recency of purchases, and a set recommended products were found for each customer. 
										Prices of the entire product range were updated dynamically according to recent sales trends, quantity in stock and competitor 
										benchmarking, before adding personalised discounts according to each customer's value segment.
									</b></p></i>
									<section>

											<h3>1. Project objectives</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											&nbsp; &#x25cf; &nbsp; Segment customers according to recency, frequency and monetary value of their purchases (RFM scores).<br>
											&nbsp; &#x25cf; &nbsp; Cluster products using TF-IDF of product descriptions and recommend product for each customer.<br>
											&nbsp; &#x25cf; &nbsp; Scrape and clean competitor prices from price comparison site.<br>
											&nbsp; &#x25cf; &nbsp; Assess success rate with different demographics and suggest improvements.<br>
											&nbsp; &#x25cf; &nbsp; Set prices for recommended products based on competitor pricing, cost, sales history and quantity in stock 
											and apply personalised discounts.<br>
										</p><br>

											<h3>2. Methodology</h3>
										</header>
										<h1>2.1. Data collection and preprocessing</h1><br>
										<p>The customer dataset contains basic demographics data, a record of recently purchased products and the recency, frequency 
											and monetary value of purchases (RFM). 
											<br><br>
											The product dataset was scraped from a price comparison site using BeautifulSoup. Its data includes product descriptions 
											and the current sale prices of competitors.
											<br><br>
											During the cleaning process, duplicate products, products with descriptions in languages other than English, and products 
											lacking competitor price data were removed. Each customer was randomly assigned products for their purchase history.
										</p><br>
										<h1>2.2. Customer segmentation</h1><br>
										<p>Customers were segmented using RFM scores, based on the frequency (total number) of purchases, the recency of the last purchase 
											in the past 36 months, and the total monetary of value to date. Each customer's values for recency, frequency, and monetary 
											value were converted to single digits from 1 to 3,  and these three digits were concatenated to give a three-digit RFM score 
											denoting the customers overall value. There were 27 possible RFM scores in total, from the lowest score of 111, to the highest, 333.</p><br>

										  </div>
										<span style="font-size:10pt"><i>Figure 1: Recency, Frequency, Monetary values converted to RFM scores.</i></span></p>
										<br>
										<p>The 27 RFM scores were divided into five groups to create five customer segments based on customer value to the company, allowing 
											separate discounts to be defined for each segment.</p><br>

										  </div>
										<span style="font-size:10pt"><i>Figure 2: Customers segmented on value (RFM scores)</i></span></p><br>
										<h1>2.3. Product clustering and recommendation system</h1><br>
										<p>The similarity of products was determined by analysing the text of each product's description.  Each text was tokenised, 
											stopwords were removed and a TF-IDF score (term frequency-inverse document frequency) was calculated and stored as 
											a vector.  
										</p>
										<p>The cosine distance between each vectors was calculated (figure 3) to determine the most similar products to each 
											customers most recently purchased product. Several products were selected for each customer to be sold individually 
											and as part of a bundle.</p><br>

										<span style="font-size:10pt"><i>Figure 4: Products recommended for each previous purchase</i></span></p><br>
										<h1>2.4. Dynamic pricing</h1><br>
										<p>The prices of the entire product list was updated dynamically based on current stock levels and recent upward or downward 
											trends in sales to encourage sales of slow-moving products and maximise revenue from popular products. To ensure all 
											prices remain below the most expensive competitor, a further reduction was applied to products exceeding this benchmark. 
										</p>
										<p>Personalised discounts were applied for each customer segment to reward existing customers and encourage lost high-value 
											customers to return. A check was run to ensure all prices remain above a minimum profit margin of 10%.
										</p><br>

										<span style="font-size:10pt"><i>Figure 5: Dynamically defined new standard prices and personalised discount prices</i></span></p><br>
										<h1>2.5. Limitations</h1><br>
										<p>Stopwords and other common words were removed from product descriptions, since they could influence the TF-IDF values. 
											For this task, removing this context does not create significant ambiguity. In addition, removing stopwords reduces the 
											number of features, which contributes to a reduction in computational cost.</p><br>

										<h3>3. Results</h3>
										</header>
										<p><div class="scroll-container">
											<img src="images/project-product-recommend3.jpg" alt="" style="width:450px;">
										  </div>
										<span style="font-size:10pt"><i>Figure 6: A product selected for a customer with new calculated price</i></span></p><br>
										<p>
											The dynamic pricing process resulted in a price increase for 12% of products and a decrease for 17% of products. 8% of 
											products were then found to exceed the highest competitor benchmark, so a further reduction was applied.
										</p>
										<p>
											After applying the personalised discounts, 10% of product prices fell below the minimum profit margin, so these prices 
											were adjusted to meet the minimum rate.
										</p>
										<p>
											Customer buying behaviour varies significantly by customer type (Business, Student, Standard). Customers in the business 
											category purchased fewer bundles than other categories and bought less recommended products overall. Conversely, students 
											buy the most bundles of any customer type. Female customers in the Standard category rank second in bundle purchases and 
											show equal interest in bundles and individual products, buying the most recommended products of any customer type. Standard 
											male customers purchase fewer bundles than women but buy the most individual items.

											<h3>4. Insights</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											The results highlight the importance of tailoring marketing approaches to each customer segment. Continual 
											improvement can be achieved through ongoing monitoring of the recommendation system's success rates, enabling informed 
											adjustments to the marketing strategy.
											<br><br>
											In the future, A/B testing could be conducted on price to determine the price sensitivity of distinct customer types, 
											allowing for more refined pricing strategies to be implemented.
